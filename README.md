            <h2>Welcome to Malnutrition Awareness</h2>
            <p>Malnutrition is a serious global health issue that affects millions of individuals, particularly children, in both developed and developing countries. It encompasses various conditions, including stunting, wasting, underweight, and overweight, each with its own set of challenges and implications for health and well-being.</p>
            <p>This website aims to provide valuable information about different forms of malnutrition, their causes, consequences, and potential solutions. By raising awareness and sharing knowledge, we hope to contribute to efforts aimed at combating malnutrition and improving the lives of individuals and communities worldwide.</p>

            <h2>Stunting</h2>
            <p>Stunting, also known as linear growth retardation, is a critical indicator of chronic malnutrition in children. It occurs when a child fails to achieve their expected height for their age group. Stunting is often a result of inadequate nutrition during the first 1,000 days of life, including the prenatal period. It can have long-term consequences on physical and cognitive development, leading to reduced adult height, diminished cognitive abilities, and increased susceptibility to diseases. Addressing stunting requires a focus on improving maternal nutrition, promoting breastfeeding, and providing access to balanced diets for infants and young children.</p>

        <section id="wasting" style="display: none;">
            <h2>Wasting</h2>
            <p>Wasting, or acute malnutrition, refers to a rapid loss of weight and muscle mass often caused by a severe lack of food and essential nutrients. It is a critical condition that demands immediate attention as it can lead to life-threatening complications, especially in children under five. Wasting is often indicative of a crisis situation, such as famine or conflict. Timely intervention with therapeutic feeding programs and access to therapeutic foods can help reverse wasting and prevent its devastating effects on children's health.</p>

        </section>
        <section id="underweight" style="display: none;">
            <h2>Underweight</h2>
            <p>Underweight is a condition where a person's weight is significantly lower than the expected weight for their age and height. It is a common consequence of chronic malnutrition and insufficient caloric intake. Underweight individuals often lack the energy and nutrients necessary for proper bodily functions, making them vulnerable to infections and other health complications. Addressing underweight involves improving overall dietary intake, ensuring access to nutritious foods, and addressing underlying socio-economic factors that contribute to malnutrition.</p>

        </section>
        <section id="overweight" style="display: none;">
            <h2>Overweight</h2>
            <p>Overweight, on the other hand, refers to an excessive accumulation of body fat, often resulting from a diet high in calories and low in nutritional value, combined with a sedentary lifestyle. Overweight individuals are at an increased risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and certain types of cancer. Overweight and obesity are not limited to affluent populations; they are increasingly prevalent in low and middle-income countries due to changes in dietary habits and physical activity levels. Combating overweight involves promoting balanced diets, encouraging regular physical activity, and raising awareness about the risks associated with excess body weight.</p>
